# Small-Programs
Mostly fun programs, either implementing interesting algorithms or performing simple tasks

Maze.c / Maze.exe : Using randomized Kruskal's algorithm to generate MAZES! Silly fun program, found it in an old linux laptop of mine. Compile however you wish, then run through cmd/terminal, but make sure to zoom out using ctrl+mouse wheel before you call or it'll be all ugly! Added a .exe version which you can run directly through the cmd on Windows if you don't wish to compile.
